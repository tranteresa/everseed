# Everseed

## What is Everseed?
Everseed is a case study that examines the design of a carbon footprint reducing application.  

## Motivation
Climate Change and Global Warming are causing devastating impacts on the ecosystem and human communities. 

Everseed is a goals and education based application that helps users take the first steps towards reducing their carbon footprint. This mobile application incorporates user motivation and social responsibility to guide users towards positive change.

## My Role
I created the concept, research, and design for the mobile application and product showcase.
